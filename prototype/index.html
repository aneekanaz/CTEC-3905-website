				Hi I am a second year student at De Montfort University and this is my comic book website.

				<br/>

				I was asked to design a website and include a comic book of my choice. I choose to base my comic book on The Lion King. My comic consist of 5 pages with images taken by myself, and edited by me using Photoshop. The comic is based on a scene taken from the film, one of my favourite scenes.
				<br />
				<br/>

				I hope you enjoy my website and find it fun!!!
